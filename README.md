# Features and How to Use

- **Copy Selected Text**: Just drag to select text, and it will automatically be copied to the clipboard.
- **Paste from Clipboard**: Click the middle mouse button (mouse wheel click) on a text area or text box to instantly paste the clipboard contents.
- **Clear Text Boxes**: Scroll the mouse wheel while hovering over a text box to quickly clear its contents and prepare for new input.
- **Change Dropdown Selections**: Scroll the mouse wheel while hovering over a dropdown menu to easily change the selected option.
- **Scroll Page with Middle Button Drag**: Hold the middle mouse button and drag to scroll the page proportionally to the mouse movement.
- **Resize Images with Right Button Drag**: Right-click and drag on an image to scale it proportionally. Dragging right or down enlarges the image, while dragging left or up shrinks it. To reset the image to its original size, simply right-click on it.
